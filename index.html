            "I became a certified Burrito Architect halfway through the course, 
            and the skills I gained were fresher than a taco truck on Tuesday! 
            I’m now designing burrito blueprints at a virtual salsa startup.
             Totally worth every spicy cent!"

            "I was a llama wrangler before joining the program. I signed up on 
            a whim and never looked back! The next 12 weeks were intense, full
             of burrito schematics, salsa theory, and guacamole 101. Since 
             finishing the course, I've been on cloud queso!"

            My coding confidence is now through the roof. One of the best
             investments I ever made—right after my rubber duck collection!
            "I came in knowing absolutely nothing about code, but I left with
             the skills to build a (mostly stable) website for my duck fan 
             club. My TA even helped me debug at midnight once—legendary!"

            Before this, I’d never even looked at a line of code. Now? I’m 
            coding circles around myself! 100% recommended for anyone who 
            wants to laugh-cry while learning how to break the internet 
            (on purpose).I was convinced to join by a distant cousin’s
             friend’s barber, who raved about this bootcamp. The team 
             project was called Operation Pizza Time, where we built an app 
             to track every pizza slice ever eaten in the city. That app 
             alone helped me land a job as a Full-Stack Pizza Analyst!"

            An amazing, confetti-filled journey! I’m now the proud owner

            The TA squad was fire—supportive, sassy, and a little too obsessed
             with kombucha. They taught me everything from code to navigating
              existential crises. I am forever grateful!

            "These legends genuinely cared about me and my journey. I left the 
            course with the confidence to present myself as a Junior Code Wizard 
            Extraordinaire and was immediately hired by a startup that makes 
            socks for hedgehogs. Life-changing!"
